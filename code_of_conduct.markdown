All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at the SwiftCairo meetup are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organisers will enforce this code throughout the event. We are expecting cooperation from all participants to help ensuring a safe environment for everybody.

# **The Quick Version**
SwiftCairo is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. SwiftCairo participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled at the discretion of the organisers.

# **The Less Quick Version**
Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Sponsors and hosts are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the SwiftCairo organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the SwiftCairo organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion.

SwiftCairo organisers will be happy to help participants contact security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the meetup. We value your attendance.

We expect participants to follow these rules at SwiftCairo meetups and workshop venues and related social events.
